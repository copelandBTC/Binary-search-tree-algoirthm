# Binary-search-tree-algoirthm
An assignment for my data structures class in which I had to develop an algorithm that inserted into, deleted from, and traversed a binary tree in various orders. The binary tree for this project was required to be threaded, utilizing pointers to make operations as efficient as possible. This assignment was done in the Ada programming language.
